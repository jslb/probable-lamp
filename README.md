The program can be excuted using ./emulator after the repo has been cloned.

The program uses the 'input' file to run.

./emulator input <enter>

To compile on Linux use:
	
	gcc emulator.c -o emulator <enter>
	
	./emulator <enter>


The following instructions are accepted by the emulator:
**************************************************************************
Instruction	- Description				- Example input
**************************************************************************
	ADD		- Add and store result		- add r4, r4, #1
	SUB		- Subtract and store result	- sub r5, r5, #1
	CMP		- Compare to value		- cmp r3, #111
	MOV		- Move value to reg		- mov r8, #65
	SWI		- SWI Exit call			- swi SWI_Exit
	LDR		- Load str from mem		- ldr r4,=str
	LDRB		- Load byte from mem		- ldrb r3, [r4]
	BEQ		- Branch if equal		- beq branch
	BGT		- Branch if greater than	- beq branch
	B		- Loads Branch			- b branch
	STRB		- Stores byte			- strb r8, [r4]


## Future Developments

There are many more instructions left to impliment before this simulator is complete. 

Next steps should include the addition of:
		
		 - The MUL instruction - multiply and store result
		 - The SWP and SWPB - swapping words or btyes 
		 - Logical opertations including : AND, EOR and ORR

Further work on opcodes should be considered next, in addition to the full binary string instruction being generated and accetped by the emulator.
